Player.cs
-Put the 'Recording manager' gameObject into the "Recorder Object" slot
	-The "Recorder" will be filled in automatically
-The 'Up','Down','Left', and 'Right' items refer to sprite arrays.
	-They should each have two elements.
	-The elements should be the sprites associated with that movement
		Ex: The "Up" array should have the FBackWalk1 and FBackWalk2 sprites

Ghost.cs
-Put the 'Recording manager gameObject into the "Recorder Object" slot
-Put the PLAYER IS FOR REAL gameObject into the "Player Object" slot
	-the Player Script slot will be filled in automatically
-The "Ghost Recording" box tells the ghost which array to read from the Recording manager
	-Type in either "recording 1" (lowercase with the space), "recording 2", or "recording 3" depending on which ghost it is and which recording button it is associated with

RecordingTrigger.cs
-"Recorder Object" and "Player Object" require the same input as the Ghost script
-Put the 'Ghost' gameObject that you want associated with this recording button into the "Ghost" paramter
	-The "Recording Number" parameter you type out should match identically with the "Ghost Recording" parameter for the Ghost object you are using

StopRecording.cs
-Only one of these is needed, as clicking it once will affect all ghosts in the scene
-"Player Object" is the same as it is on the Trigger and Ghost
-Starting Sprite is the sprite that will be used when the player is reset back to their starting point
	-For testing, I used the FFront_Layer 2
-Each ghost gameObject in the scene should be placed as an element within the "Ghost Objects" array
-Change the size of the array to the exact number of Ghosts it is using

PlayRecording.cs
-Each play button is associated with a particular Ghost object
-The "Recorder Object" uses the same manager object as everything else
-The "Ghost Object" is the Ghost gameObject that this play button will be associated with
-The "Recording Number" should be the exact same string that is typed into the associated Ghost's "Ghost Recording" (either "recording 1", "recording 2", or "recording 3")
